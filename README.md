## How to Use

Just click on any block to add your task for that hour. If you'd like to save your tasks, hit a Save Button located to the right of the tasks. 

If you'd like to reschedule a task for a different hour, simply drag that block and drop it over the hour you'd like to schedule the task for. When you drop it, your task will switch to it's new block!

And use the color code to always know which time block is in the present.  The grey blocks indicate the past, the green blocks indicat the future, and the red block is the current hour. So get on that current task!
